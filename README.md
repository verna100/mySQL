mySQL homework


Task: In this activity, you'll be creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

Challenge #1: Customer View 
Create a MySQL Database called bamazon.
Then create a Table inside of that database called products.
The products table should have each of the following columns:
-item_id (unique id for each product)
-product_name (Name of product)
-department_name
-price (cost to customer)
-stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)
**Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).
